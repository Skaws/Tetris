# Creation and Purpose

This project was made as a personal challenge to recreate one of my favourite video games - Tetris, from scratch using Java. This was pursued with the aim of furthering my understanding of the Java programming language, object oriented programming and general data structure manipulation.

# How to Run

The game can be run by compling Main.java via "javac Main.java" and then executing it via "java Main". Alternatively opening the directory in an IDE and running Main should suffice.
